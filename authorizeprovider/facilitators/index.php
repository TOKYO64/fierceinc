		<h1>Certified to spread (and teach) the skill set</h1>
		<p>At Fierce, we often say that &ldquo;the most valuable thing any of us can do is find a way to say the things that can't be 
			said.&rdquo; Our Certified Facilitators are individuals who have been certified in just that skill, and more &mdash; 
			they are people who have successfully completed the Fierce Train-the-Trainer program, and are now certified to lead 
			Fierce training sessions.</p>
