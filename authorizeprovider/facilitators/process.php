		<h1>the process</h1>
		<p>Becoming a certified Fierce Facilitator is no small thing. We believe that the skill with which our programs are 
			delivered has everything to do with achieving results. Or not.</p>
		<p>Therefore, we do not simply hand out certificates, slap you on the back, and hurry you out the door. Our process requires 
			you to &ldquo;show up&rdquo;. Fully. And, quite often, your facilitation skills will noticeably improve as a direct result.</p>
		<p>In order to facilitate any Fierce program, you must receive your certification in Fierce Conversations. Our foundational 
			program. A must-have to become certifiably &ldquo;fierce&rdquo;.</p>
		<p>Here is what you can expect.</p>
		<br/>
		<h2>preparation</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Speak with a Fierce team member to enroll in the program.</li>
			<li>Review the Fierce Train-the-Trainer Materials and know the content cold.</li>
			<li>Read <a class="book" title="Visit the Fierce Conversations website" href="http://www.fierceconversations.com" target="Fierce"><em>Fierce Conversations &mdash; Achieving Success at Work &amp; in Life, One Conversation at a Time</em></a> by Susan Scott.</li>
		</ul>
		<br/>
		<h2>certification class</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Attend a 2 or 3-Day Train-the-Trainer Certification class led by a Master Facilitator. For large groups within a 
				single organization, closed sessions may be arranged.</li>
			<li>Deliver your Content assignments to the group throughout the event.</li>
			<li>Actively participate by giving and receiving feedback.</li>
			<li>Upon class completion, you will receive your Certification Level.</li>
		</ul>
		<br/>
		<h2>next steps</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>If you have received our highest level of Certification (&ldquo;leaf&rdquo; level), you are free to begin training in all Fierce 
				programs. Hooray!</li>
			<li>If you have received a Certification Level below &ldquo;leaf&rdquo; level, a Master Facilitator will work with you to create 
				a process that will bring you to full certification. Quite often, this involves co-facilitating with 
				either a certified Fierce Facilitator or one of your internal trainers who has achieved &ldquo;leaf&rdquo; level.</li>
