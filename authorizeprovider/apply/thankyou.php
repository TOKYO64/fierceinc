			<p>Thank you for submitting your application and for your interest in becoming a Fierce Authorized Provider. Our next 
				step is to review your application which generally takes between 5 to 7 business days. We will then be in contact 
				via email or phone to discuss the opportunity at length and to determine fit.</p>
			<p>If you have any questions before that time, please call 206.787.1100 and ask for Traci Towle, although we would 
				prefer to discuss program details once we've had an opportunity to thoroughly review your submission. You can 
				find general information and resources about our Authorized Provider program on our website by clicking
