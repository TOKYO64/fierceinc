		<h1>Helping us to build a better world</h1>
		<p>Our unabashed vision at Fierce is to &ldquo;build a better world, one conversation at a time.&rdquo; As part of that vision, we 
			provide qualified and like-minded organizations with a mutually equitable opportunity to deliver Fierce programs to 
			their own, unique audiences.</p>
		<p>We call them Authorized Providers, and they are individuals or organizations that have met the necessary requirements 
			to independently sell and deliver Fierce programs to their clientele. Authorized Providers may employ their own 
			Certified Fierce Facilitator(s) to lead the sessions, or may hire one out from another cooperating Authorized Provider, 
			Authorized Training Center, or directly from Fierce, when available.</p>
		<p>To ensure your success as a provider and tour guide of Fierce, one person in your Authorized Provider organization 
			must attend the Train-the-Trainer session; this person can be the same individual who also serves as your Certified 
			Facilitator.</p>
