			<p>In <span class="em">Fierce Leadership</span>, Scott teaches us how to spot the worst “best” practices in our organizations using a technique she calls “squid eye”&mdash;the ability to see the “tells” or signs that we have fallen prey to disastrous behaviors  by knowing what to look for. Only then, she says, can we apply the antidote...</p>

			<p>Informed by over a decade of conversations with Fortune 500 executives, this book is that antidote. With fierce new approaches to everything from employee feedback to corporate diversity to customer relations, Scott offers fresh and surprising alternatives to six of the so-called “best” practices permeating today’s businesses. This refreshingly candid book is a must-read for any manager or leader at any level who is ready to take a long hard look at what trouble might be lurking in their organization&mdash;and do something about it.</p>
